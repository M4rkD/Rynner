Rynner project is currently under heavy development. You should expect a bumpy ride at this point and APIs, interfaces and names may change without warning. This project is currently not production-ready.

There are a large number of open issues, in particular on Windows platforms.

People interested in the future or progress of this project, contributing to development, and updates on API changes:
