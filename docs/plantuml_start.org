JobType => dict (immutable) -> contains list of actions
   'action'

JobTypeDefaults => dict of dicts (defined in the framework, e.g. 'serial')
JobTypes => list (mutable)

-> easy to inspect contents

ClusterConfig => dict immutable (is this code or data)?
Clusters => list object (mutable!)

Submit a job:

def fetch_jobs(self):
   # fetches jobs from the cluster, return a list of jobs -> caches them in the standard model, until refresh?
   # supported cluster abstractions


1) Fetch the current jobs (list of dicts)
2) List the current jobs (list of dicts)
